# BLE-Gyro-HID
This project is to create a low-cost human interface device (HID) that enables people with motor impairments control phones and computers. Basically, a mouse that requires very limited head movements to operate.

The device uses a gyroscope mounted to an earpiece to track head movements (very little movement required) and move a mouse pointer accordingly. The device has 4 optional switch / button inputs (3.5mm headphone jack) for use with any switches that the user can control.
